# inQ

## Description

A web app so I can ask people dumb questions and log their responses.

Each page is a question. A question can have a set number of answers or free form. You can also take notes.

## The goal

User can make a question with an assortment of responses using some sort of form. This question goes to a list of questions that anyone can view. Anyone can click on the question and fill out the form, but only a surveyer (someone with the question's password) can submit the response to the question. Each question holds references to the relevant responses. For each question, any person can see the statistics from the responses.
